VLANS

- assign pc1 & pc3 to vlan 1, and pc2 & pc4 to vlan 1 
- ping to check connectivity 

configuring interfaces connecting sw1 and s2 as trun interfaces

ping again

directions

1. lets ping 
2. go into sw1 to assing vlan1 to pc1 and pc2

Notes regarding commands in SW1 
switchport mode access enable by deafult, but good practice to do it
Native vlan is by default vlan 1
For secuirty reasons we want to change this
use show running-config to verify these changes
the name vlan 2 will appear only
vlan 1 name will not appear under f0/2 because is the native vlan

Commands 
enable
conf t
int f0/2
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan 1
int f0/3
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan 2
end
sh running-config

Notes regarding commands in SW2
*Same as SW1*

- Lets do a ping test again
PC1 > pc3 (same vlan1) ping sucessful 
pc2 > pc4 (same vlan2) failed ping

Why did ping in VLAN 1 was successful but
ping in VLAN 2 was not ?

- This is because VLAN 1 is a native vlan and all traffic
goes through the native vlan


How to fix this:

We have to configure the interface connecting both switches
which in this cases is F0/1 as a trunk interface 


Lets start on SW1 
Comands
enable 
conf t 
int f0/1
switch mode trunk

Now SW2
comands 
enable 
conf t 
int f0/1
switch mode trunk

Lets ping again
PC1 > pc3 (same vlan1) ping sucessful 
pc2 > pc4 (same vlan2) ping sucessful
